# CheXpert : A Large Chest X-Ray Dataset and Competition
A repository created for the MAP583 Deep Learning project.

This competition launched by the Stanford ML group aims at finding a prediction model which could perform as well as radiologist to find different pathologies thanks to chest X-Ray. The Dataset available to train our model is composed of 223,414 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients.

The dataset (the smaller dataset size is 11 GB) can be requested on the website of the competition: https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/
